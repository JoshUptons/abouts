# Quick Projects

#### Why?
To give some quick scripts to fire up a project with various features, functionality and infrastructure.  
The main purpose is to document and build my most frequently used apps/infrastructure more efficiently, by eliminating the repetitive, laborious tasks.


#### How?
To begin with, I will add sub-folders for particular container types, with rudimentary features.  
From there the creating of a simple scripting tool to pull them together and deploy to a new repo will be undertaken.
